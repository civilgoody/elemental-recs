Below is a 14-day “take-no-prisoners” plan built around how hiring really happens (referrals → private groups → public posts → job boards).
Each stage is time-boxed so you can execute fast and track progress.

## 0 – Same-day prep (evening of Day 0)

| Asset              | 35-word checklist                                                                       |            |                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resume**         | Role-focused headline, 3 bullet “impact metrics” per job, links to code / demos.        |            |                                                                                                    |
| **LinkedIn**       | Banner = “Actively looking • Backend                                                    | TypeScript | NestJS”. Enable “Open to work – recruiters only”, add **#OpenToNewOpportunities** keyword section. |
| **Portfolio repo** | One polished project that compiles in 1 command. Include 30-second Loom walkthrough.    |            |                                                                                                    |
| **Calendar**       | Block 9 AM – 1 PM daily for outreach + interviews; 2 PM – 5 PM for coding tests + prep. |            |                                                                                                    |

---

## 1 – Tap the *warm* network (Days 1-2)

1. **Pull your memory dump** – list every team-mate, mentor, boot-camp buddy, and recruiter you’ve met.
2. Send a two-paragraph “ask for *names*, not jobs” email / DM.
3. Post identical note on WhatsApp Status & Instagram Story (high view-rate, zero competition).

> **Template (adapt):**
> “Hey <Name>, I’m wrapping up at <X>. I build TypeScript APIs at prod scale and I’m available **by June 15**. If you hear of anyone needing a backend dev, could you intro me?”

Aim: 20 personal messages ➜ 6 conversations ➜ 2 referrals.

---

## 2 – Infiltrate private groups (Days 1-5)

| Platform                       | How to find / join quickly                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Why it matters                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WhatsApp**                   | • *Nigeria Software Engineers* FB group – post contains fresh WA invite. ([Facebook][1])  <br>• *African Programmers* WA group on Nairaland. ([Nairaland][2]) <br>• *Port Harcourt Web Programmers* WA group. ([Nairaland][3]) | WA alerts hit phones instantly; openings are shared before they leak elsewhere.                 |
| **Telegram**                   | • *JobsToday – Jobs in Nigeria, Freelance & Remote* channel. ([Telegram][4])  <br>• *LagosJobs* channel (link in IG post). ([Instagram][5])                                                                                    | Hire-managers dump JD PDFs here for speed; hardly indexed on the web.                           |
| **Slack**                      | • *DevCareer* Africa Slack – strong recruiter presence. ([devcareer.io][6])  <br>• Global *SlackCommunity* chapters – join the “developer-jobs” channel. ([Slack Community][7])                                                | Channels such as **#jobs-remote** or local *#lagos-tech-jobs* host referral threads every week. |
| **Discord**                    | Remote dev job communities listed in the *Awesome-Remote-Job* repo – includes open Discord invites. ([GitHub][8])  <br>*Invidelabs remote-jobs* server shares 10 vetted roles/week. ([Remote Dev Diary by Invide][9])          | Lower noise, many early-stage founders hang out here looking for first hires.                   |
| **Facebook / LinkedIn Groups** | Search: **“software engineer jobs referral”**, **“remote dev hiring”**, filter *Groups → Most Recent*. Join & enable **All Posts** notifications.                                                                              | Still the default for SME founders in Nigeria.                                                  |

**Search-shortcut keywords**

```
"software engineer" (hire OR hiring OR referral OR opening) ("WhatsApp group" OR "Telegram" OR "Slack invite")
"remote" (javascript OR typescript OR node OR react) "channel"
```

Run those queries on Google, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, and Facebook; sort by *Past Month*.

---

## 3 – Direct-to-hiring-manager blitz (Days 3-10)

1. **Build a 30-company hit-list**:

   * Filter LinkedIn by *“Posted in past 24 h”, “<50 applicants”, “Mid-Senior”, “Remote”*.
   * Add YC’s *WorkAtAStartup* and smaller boards like **RemoteOK**.
2. **Find the real decision-maker** (Eng Manager, CTO). Use Hunter.io + LinkedIn mutual connections.
3. **Send a 7-line cold email** (max 80 words):

   * *Hook*: 1-sentence stat (“Scaled NestJS APIs to 3 M req/day”)
   * *Pain*: reference their stack/open role.
   * *Proof*: GitHub link + 1 testimonial.
   * *Ask*: “15-min chat tomorrow?”
4. **Follow-up cadence**: Day 2, Day 4, Day 8 (polite bump with new value).

Expect \~15-20 % reply rate → 4-6 first-round calls.

---

## 4 – Public-visibility spike (Days 3-14)

### A. Viral LinkedIn post

* Use the “referral bounty” playbook that went viral earlier this year (engineers offering up to **\$10 k** for an intro). ([Business Insider][10])
* Adapt: offer a ₦100 k (\~\$70) airtime voucher per successful intro (cheap, eye-catching).
* Structure: story (3 lines) → clear *role wish-list* → bounty → CTA “Tag anyone hiring”.

Post at 9 AM WAT, tag 5 high-engagement friends to comment in the first 10 minutes.

### B. #BuildInPublic flash project

Pick a micro-SAAS or open-source utility (e.g., “Prisma schema diff visualizer”), ship MVP in 48 h, tweet the repo link in relevant hashtags **#Prisma**, **#OpenSource**, **#HiringEngineers**.

---

## 5 – Recruiter short-circuit (Days 5-12)

* Register with niche tech agencies (e.g., *BigThree Africa Tech Recruiters*, *Turing*, *Andela Talent Cloud*) and set availability flag as **“Immediate”**.
* Promise *same-day CV tweaks + coding test turnaround* – this makes you the low-friction candidate they push first.

---

## 6 – Job-board “snipe” strategy (Days 7-14)

You said you don’t want the crowded boards, so instead:

1. Subscribe to RSS feeds of **RemoteOK** + **SlashJobs** with the query `javascript OR node` and pipe into Slack.
2. Apply within 3 hours of posting (cuts the applicant pool by \~70 %).
3. Pair every application with *one* LinkedIn message to an employee.

---

## 7 – Interview sprint & closing (Days 10-14)

* **DS/Algo brush-up**: Grind 10 leetcode easy + 5 medium daily; focus on patterns likely for JS back-end (arrays, hash-maps, async).
* **System-design flashcards**: have 5-minute whiteboard outlines for URL shortener, chat app, and video feed (TikTok experience!).
* **Mock interviews**: book at least 3 on Pramp / peers in your new groups.

## Guard-rails & anti-scam checks

| Red flag                          | Mitigation                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Group asks for “registration fee” | Skip – legit recruiters bill the employer.                        |
| Unverifiable company email        | Cross-check domain on Crunchbase, use video call before any test. |
| NDA before job description        | Ask for anonymised JD first.                                      |

---

## Daily schedule template

| Time (WAT)  | Activity                                  | KPI                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 09:00-11:00 | Cold outreach + follow-ups                | 10 personalised emails            |
| 11:00-13:00 | Group monitoring & quick applications     | Join 3 groups, respond to 5 leads |
| 14:00-15:30 | Coding challenge / leetcode               | ≥1 complete submission            |
| 15:30-17:00 | Interviews or mock sessions               | 1 per day                         |
| 20:00-20:30 | LinkedIn engagement (comment on 10 posts) | Keep algorithm warm               |

---

### What you might have missed

* **Meetups/Hackathons:** GDG Port Harcourt often runs Saturday meet-ups—great for instant face-time. ([gdgportharcourt.blogspot.com][11])
* **Alumni portals:** Most universities have hidden job boards accessible with student email.
* **Content referrals:** Publish a 700-word blog on “Scaling NestJS with Prisma on Postgres 16” and share in groups; authority draws inbound DMs.
* **Early-stage startups:** Founders post directly on X/Twitter before HR exists—search `("hiring" AND "first engineer") (since:2025-05-28)`.

---

## Final word

Execute the plan in order, track each outreach in a simple spreadsheet, and keep your phone un-muted. With \~100 targeted touches, 4–6 live interview loops, and the viral-post bump, two offers in 14 days is *achievable*.

Get moving—the first WhatsApp invite above closes at 256 members. Good luck!
