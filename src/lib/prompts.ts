export function generateRecommendationPrompt(title1: string, title2: string, title3: string): string {
  return `You are an expert movie and TV show recommendation assistant.
A user has provided three titles they enjoyed:
1. "${title1}"
2. "${title2}"
3. "${title3}"

Your task is to:
A. Thoroughly analyze what is common across these three titles. Consider elements such as genre, subgenre, themes, narrative style, character archetypes, directors, actors, tone, pacing, and potential underlying reasons why a person might enjoy all three.
B. Based on this analysis, recommend exactly 5 new movies or TV shows that the user would likely enjoy.
C. For each recommendation, provide the following information in JSON format:

Please format your entire response as a single JSON object with a key 'recommendations' which is an array of objects, where each object contains 'title', 'year', 'type', 'brief_reasoning', and optionally 'country' and 'original_language' for better identification.

Example format:
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "title": "The Matrix",
      "year": 1999,
      "type": "Movie",
      "brief_reasoning": "Like your favorites, this combines philosophical themes with innovative visual storytelling and explores questions about reality and human nature.",
      "country": "US",
      "original_language": "en"
    }
  ]
}

Important guidelines:
- Be as specific as possible with titles (include original titles if different from English)
- For anime, specify if it's the anime version vs live-action
- Include country of origin (US, JP, KR, etc.) when relevant for identification
- Include original language (en, ja, ko, etc.) when helpful
- Focus on providing diverse and high-quality recommendations that go beyond obvious surface-level similarities
- Prioritize titles that are well-regarded or critically acclaimed if they fit the user's taste profile
- Do not recommend the input titles themselves
- Ensure the year is accurate and the type is either "Movie" or "TV Show"`;
